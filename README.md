# Fetching Dog Data with TanStack Query

This was a project for my Mobile Application Development class.

Objective: "Learn to use the TanStack Query to retrieve data from the Dog API, and understand how to process and display this data in your application."

I incorporated this into a React Expo application. I ran "npm install -g expo-cli" to load the appropriate packages for the project and ran "expo init (project name)" to initialize the project (though "npx create-expo-app --template") is now recommended. I used a blank (TypeScript) template to work with. 

The code from the DogData.tsx app serves a culmination of the various iterations of the app at various points. The final version here brings all of the concepts previously explored in retrieving information all together.
